# Console-Finances data analysis 

## Description

The project deals with a financial analysis of a data set using javaScript. My motivation was to improve my programming skills in JavaScript using functions and/or code structures as clear as possible. An array type variable called finances is given with two records (date and amount) on the data of which I did the following:
- I have displayed the total number of months;
- I have displayed the total amount;
- I displayed the average amount variation;
- I displayed the largest increase in the variation of the amount and the date on which it occurred;
- I have displayed the largest decrease in the variation of the amount and the date on which it occurred;

## Installation

Running the Code
1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Open the browser's developer console (usually opening it in Google Chrome).
3. The financial analysis results will be displayed in the console.
My example:

## Usage

Code Structure
- `index.html`: Contains the basic HTML structure and script tag to load the JavaScript code.
- `index.js`: Contains the JavaScript code that performs the financial analysis.
