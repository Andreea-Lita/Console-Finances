# Console-Finances data analysis 

## Description

The project deals with a financial analysis of a data set using javaScript. My motivation was to improve my programming skills in JavaScript using functions and/or code structures as clear as possible. An array type variable called finances is given with two records (date and amount) on the data of which I did the following:
- I have displayed the total number of months;
- I have displayed the total amount;
- I displayed the average amount variation;
- I displayed the largest increase in the variation of the amount and the date on which it occurred;
- I have displayed the largest decrease in the variation of the amount and the date on which it occurred;

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

## Installation
Running the Code

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
